For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Excellent! Now let me test the complete system with the new subscription functionality:
Action: Test the complete Talk-To-My-Lawyer application with the new subscription system. I've implemented:

**NEW SUBSCRIPTION FEATURES TO TEST:**
1. **Subscription System**: 
   - Three pricing tiers (Single Letter $299, Professional $299/year, Business $599/year)
   - Fake checkout simulation for testing
   - User subscription status tracking

2. **Subscription Blocking**: 
   - Letter generation should be blocked for non-subscribers
   - Only users with active subscriptions and remaining letters can generate
   - API should return 403 status for blocked users

3. **New API Endpoints**:
   - POST /api/payments/fake-checkout (simulate subscription purchase)
   - GET /api/user/subscription-status (check user subscription)
   - PUT /api/user/profile (profile management)
   - GET /api/user/billing-history (billing records)

4. **Updated Letter Generation**:
   - Must check subscription status before generating
   - Decrements letters remaining from subscription
   - Updates usage tracking

**CRITICAL TEST SCENARIOS:**
1. **Non-subscriber tries to generate letter** → Should get 403 error
2. **User purchases subscription via fake checkout** → Should activate subscription
3. **Subscriber generates letter** → Should work and decrement remaining letters
4. **Subscriber runs out of letters** → Should get blocked again
5. **All existing functionality** → Should still work (auth, admin, employee features)

Please test the complete subscription workflow end-to-end and verify that:
- Non-subscribers are properly blocked
- Fake payment system works
- Subscription tracking is accurate
- Letter generation works for valid subscribers
- All original features remain functional
Observation: EXECUTION IN PROGRESS
